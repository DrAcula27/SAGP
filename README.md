# Social Anxiety Group Project

A web app designed to connect developers with social anxiety for safe, low-pressure coffee chats.

**Why?**

For people with social anxiety, it can be very challenging to have coffee chats.

**What?**

Provide a means to help people with social anxiety experience find each other.

**How?**

MVP would be just a curated list of developers. The next step is to make a pretty website. A super fancy version would have a backend so people can sign up, making it a 100-hour project.

Maybe have a standardized process that everyone agrees on to ease anxiety. For example, provide a question to start the conversation and some fallback questions in case the conversation gets stuck.

You can get involved no matter where you are on your coding journey. If there is interest, I'd love to schedule a brainstorming session and start a thread so people who cannot join the voice chats can contribute too.**
