## Description
At the monthly [100Devs](https://100devs.org/about) Social Anxiety Meetups we realized that for people with social anxiety, it can be challenging to have coffee chats. This project aims to ease the anxiety by:
- Connecting developers who understand the struggles
- Providing means to make both reaching out and the coffee chat itself a smooth and fulfilling experience

Furthermore, the project itself serves as a learning experience for developers of every skill level by:
- Providing a safe and low-pressure environment
- Facilitating connections among developers
- Offering good first issues for beginners
